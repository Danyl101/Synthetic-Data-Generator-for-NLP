+ Republicans have a problem.Their signature economic package for 2025, the tax bill President Trump signed into law in early July, is deeply unpopular.Voters think it will harm the poor and reward the wealthy, and sober analysis suggests they're right.The last time Republicans passed a law like this, in 2017, voters pummeled them in the subsequent election.As the leader of his party, President Trump bears responsibility for selling the tax bill to voters.Instead, his main economic messaging effort this summer has been a sustained attack on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell.Trump has routinely suggested he'll try to fire Powell, perhaps hoping the Fed chair will crack under pressure and quit before his term expires next May.He has hurled a dictionary of insults at Powell, calling him "dumb," "stupid," "major loser," "knucklehead," "numbskull," "Mr. Too Late," and "the worst Federal Reserve chairman in history."Since Powell has shown no signs of quitting, Trump has suggested he'll announce a "shadow" Fed chair who will offer different monetary policy guidance until Powell's term finally ends.Trump's war on Powell serves at least three purposes.His stated reason for browbeating the Fed is to compel sharp interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy.But Trump also has a penchant for creating villains he can blame when something goes wrong, and as head of a cautious central bank, Powell fits the profile.Trump also manages his many controversies by creating new kerfuffles to distract people from existing ones.Threatening mayhem at the Fed has been a way for Trump to deflect attention from tariff-related inflation, slowing economic growth, and now, the mushrooming Jeffrey Epstein scandal.The Fed is not really causing Trump any problems.It has kept interest rates steady since last December, one source of calm in financial markets otherwise roiled by Trump's tariffs and their many unintended consequences.The Fed most likely will end up cutting rates by later this year or early next, just not as dramatically as Trump wants.Read more: How much control does the president have over the Fed and interest rates?Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on June 25 on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C.
