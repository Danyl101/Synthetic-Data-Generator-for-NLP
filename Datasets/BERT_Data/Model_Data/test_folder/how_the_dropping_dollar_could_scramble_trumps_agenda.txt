+ President Trump and his aides are closely watching the US dollar's (DX=F) drop over the first six months of this year as they track a change that could have wide-ranging effects, from how tariffs are felt to Federal Reserve policy to America's role in the world.The question, which notably remains somewhat open even among Trump's aides, is whether the net effects may include at least some positive short-term consequences for the president's agenda or whether the dollar needs to be strengthened at all costs.Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick offered a limited case for a weaker dollar on CBS over the weekend when he responded to a question about rising consumer prices by saying that "the dollar declining sort of softens tariffs completely."The currency's moves so far this year -- which have surprised some economists who expected Trump's tariffs to put pressure in the other direction -- could indeed boost exports but could also complicate Trump's goals for the coming months, primarily by pushing prices up for US consumers of foreign goods.Trump himself remains very much in the strong dollar camp, as he reiterated just a few days ago, saying that he is "never going to let the dollar slide."The only way that could happen, he added, is "if you have a dummy" as president.The somewhat mixed messaging comes as the US dollar index (DX-Y.NYB) -- a measure of the US currency against various foreign currencies -- has fallen significantly and is now down almost 10% since Inauguration Day.Declines in recent days have put the currency near two-year lows, as of early Wednesday.It's a change that, if it sticks, will have varied consequences for Trump's agenda -- and not just on the trade front.RSM's Joe Brusuelas offered in a note this week that a weakening dollar tends to be followed by inflation pressure -- "but it usually takes nine to 12 months" -- which could work most directly against Trump's keen interest in lower interest rates.If the dollar holds or declines further, the economist wrote, "such a scenario will most likely lead the Federal Reserve to hold its policy rate steady through the end of the year at best" due to inflation uncertainty.Read more: Does the president control inflation?'People vote with their feet' The somewhat surprising dollar moves so far this year have also spurred some concerns that recent declines could be early signs of a PM) CEO Jamie Dimon put it recently, "people vote with their feet," and "if people decide that the U.S. dollar isn't the place to be ... that will become a problem."
