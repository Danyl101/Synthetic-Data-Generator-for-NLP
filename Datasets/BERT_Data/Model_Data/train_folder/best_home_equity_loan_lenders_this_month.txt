it work?A home equity loan is a type of second mortgage, so you can tap your home equity without refinancing.It's a straightforward way to access the value of your home without refinancing your original mortgage or selling your house.It's an installment loan, which means you receive a lump sum of money at closing and repay it monthly over several years.Like any loan, you'll want to shop for the best interest rate and choose a loan term that results in a monthly payment you can comfortably afford.How much can homeowners borrow with home equity loans?The amount you can borrow with a home equity loan will be based on the how much equity you have in your house.Lenders will consider your outstanding mortgage balance first and lend you a sum equal to some percentage of your remaining equity.Called the combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV ratio), that share can vary from 80% to 100%.Lenders typically approve borrowers with at least 15% to 20% equity in their homes.Here's an example of a lender that allows a CLTV of up to 90%: Your home's current market value: $300,000 90% combined loan-to-value = $270,000 The balance of your existing mortgage: $200,000 The amount available for a home equity loan = $70,000 Home equity loan requirements Home equity loans are called second mortgages because you keep your original home loan and establish another mortgage using your house as collateral.Lenders will base their decision on your ability to qualify for a HEL on three primary factors: Your debt-to-income ratio (often a maximum of 50%) Your combined loan-to-value ratio (90% CLTV is common)Your credit score (a FICO of 680 or higher is typical)Mortgage lenders will also frequently require proof of insurance, income, and an appraisal of the house.Do you need an appraisal to get a home equity loan?An appraisal is usually required to get the best terms on your home equity loan.The lender wants to be confident that the home's value will serve as sufficient collateral for the second mortgage.And frankly, you want to know that you won't be "underwater" on your home with another loan -- that means you owe more than the home is worth.Not a good place to be.Sometimes, a certified appraiser may simply do a "drive-by" or remote appraisal combined with an analysis of comparable sales.Other lenders may require more thorough on-site inspections.A new trend is using automated valuation models to confirm the market price of a home instead of an appraisal.This is similar to a Zillow Zestimate.Not many lenders are doing this yet --Rocket Mortgage home equity loans are one of the few so far -- but it may be more common soon.Read more: How to qualify for a no-appraisal home equity loan Home equity loan closing costs Yahoo Finance surveyed lenders and found that they charge a variety of home equity loan closing costs.Some lenders pay the closing costs or promote "no fee" home equity loans.A similar number of lenders charge closing fees of 3% to 6% of the loan amount.There might also be annual fees, origination charges, and quite a few third-party fees.As with any loan, you'll want to shop around for the best combination of interest rates and fees.Is home equity loan interest tax deductible?If you itemize deductions, the interest you pay on a home equity loan may be deductible.The catch: According to the IRS, you must use the loan proceeds to "buy, build, or substantially improve" the home used as collateral for the HEL.If the tax break is important to you, you'll want to be sure your home improvement projects meet that "substantial improvement" standard.Home equity loan alternatives A home equity loan is not your only choice when looking to pull out some of the cash locked in the walls of your house.Here are other equity-tapping alternatives.Home equity line of credit (HELOC)The HELOC is another type of second mortgage, and it allows on-demand equity access.Structured as a line of credit rather than the HEL's lump sum, a HELOC charges interest only on the amount you've withdrawn.You can pay it down, then draw again.Or pay only the interest while drawing from your available line.The HELOC can serve as emergency cash, a home project-by-project funding machine, or a splurge-on-something-and-repay-it-later money supply (though you should always be thoughtful when deciding how to spend the funds).It's the Swiss Army knife of home equity availability.Dig deeper: Home equity loan vs. HELOC --Tapping into your equity when rates are high Cash-out refinance A cash-out refinance works when you want to trade in your old mortgage rather than have two home loans.You refi your loan and receive a chunk of your equity at closing.It's kind of nice when the bank isn't the only one getting paid at a loan signing, right?Of course, there are arguments for and against a cash-out refinance.It depends on things like interest rates, how long you'll stay in the home, and whether you shorten or lengthen the repayment period.And your financial goals.Read more: Home equity loan vs. cash-out refinance -- Which should you choose?Personal loan Using only your signature and good credit, a personal loan can be an excellent way to get cash when needed -- without putting your home at risk as collateral.The interest rate may be higher on a personal loan than on a HEL, but the payback period is often shorter on a personal loan.That means you'll likely pay it off faster than a home equity loan, though the monthly payment may be significantly higher.And closing costs on a personal loan will potentially be much lower compared to a HEL.Keep learning: Home equity loan vs. personal loan -- Which is best for home improvements?HECM reverse mortgage Tapping this home equity tool will require that you are 62 or older.A home equity conversion mortgage (HECM) is the only reverse mortgage issued by government-approved FHA lenders.With a HECM, you withdraw the equity from your home without making loan payments.You simply maintain the home while paying taxes and homeowners insurance.Meanwhile, fees accumulate but will not exceed the home's value and are recouped when you sell the house, move, or die.HECM counselors can walk you through the program.Dig deeper: Home equity loan vs. reverse mortgage vs. HELOC Lenders that did not make our best home equity loan lender list We considered the
