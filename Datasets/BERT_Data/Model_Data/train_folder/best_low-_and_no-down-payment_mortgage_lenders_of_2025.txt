carefully considered the following mortgage lenders for our best-of list, but they weren't quite as strong as our top picks: What is a down payment, and how does it work?So, what exactly is a down payment in the first place?A down payment is the money you pay at loan closing to reduce the principal of your mortgage.Some loans call for a certain amount of cash upfront; others have no down payment requirement.However, the more money you put down, the lower your mortgage interest rate and monthly mortgage payment will likely be.How much down payment do you need to buy a house?The minimum down payment needed depends on the type of mortgage you're getting.A 20% down payment has been the traditional standard, and it's the minimum required to avoid paying private mortgage insurance (PMI) -- an up-front and ongoing fee on conventional loans that protects the lender.However, loan programs have been launched in recent years that allow much lower down payments, from 0% to around 3%.Average down payment on a house According to Realtor.com, in Q4 2024, the average down payment was 14.4%.This is lower than earlier in in the year but up from Q4 2023.The median down payment amount was $30,250.Keep in mind that these are national averages and medians, so the data may be different if you live in a lower- or high-cost-of-living area.Zero-down-payment mortgage options The holy grail of home loans: mortgages with 0% down payment.Yes, they do exist, and as you might imagine, they're quite popular.Two government loans are the primary 100% financing options: VA loans and USDA-backed mortgages.VA loans It's the military benefit that has allowed generations of service members to buy a home.Backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA loans usually require no down payment and put a cap on closing costs.There is a funding fee but no upfront or ongoing mortgage insurance.And while the VA has no minimum credit score, lenders do -- and it varies from lender to lender.USDA loans Mortgages backed or issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA loans, are another 100% financing option.You don't have to be in a farming or ranching business, but the property has to be located in a rural or suburban area approved by the USDA.The loans are specifically designed to meet the housing needs of low- and moderate-income households.Low-down-payment mortgage options Coming up with 20% down is a financial leap many first-time buyers just can't make.But something around 3% -- now that's a hurdle worth taking a run at.Three low-down-payment programs are worth considering.FHA loans The venerable FHA loan has been around for nearly a century.An initiative of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the FHA mortgage offers a down payment option as low as 3.5%.Your credit score can be as low as 580, though some lenders will set a higher limit.3%-down conventional loans A relative newcomer in the low down payment arena, the conventional loan requiring only 3% down is offered by two government-sponsored companies that provide financial backing to lenders.Known as Fannie Mae HomeReady and Freddie Mac Home Possible loans, the programs open the door for more mortgage makers to offer a low-down-payment option.1%-down programs A creative solution offered by just a few lenders, this loan wraps a 2% lender grant into a 3% down mortgage.The result: You pay 1% down.There may be loan limits or household income caps for these mortgages, but each lender offering such a loan will have its own eligibility requirements.How to save for a down payment No matter how much down payment you plan to make on buying a home, saving for a house is no easy feat.Besides the cash down, there are closing costs, perhaps an earnest money deposit -- and even things as mundane as moving expenses.First, set a goal for how much you want to save, then automate money transfers to get it done.Down payment assistance programs You may have heard of down payment assistance and wondered: Who is it for, and how does it work?The programs usually offer grants or forgivable loans and can be sponsored by local and state agencies.Eligibility may be determined by where you live, your income, and whether you are a first-time home buyer.Using gift money for a down payment In 2023, more than one-third of borrowers used gifts to help come up with the down payment.Well, first, you have to hunt down a benevolent relative, friend, or charity.Different types of loans -- such as conventional, FHA, and VA loans -- have separate restrictions on who can donate the money to you and how it can be used.Best low- and no-down-payment mortgage lender FAQs What credit score is needed to buy a house with low or no money down?The minimum credit score required to qualify for low- or no-money-down financing will depend on the type of loan you are getting and the lender.Generally, an FHA loan will require a 580 credit score for 3.5% down.USDA loans with 100% financing also may look for a 580 score or higher.VA loans have no minimum credit score requirements, but lenders often call for a 620 FICO or better.And 3% down conventional loans will likely require a 620 score or better.Which type of mortgage does not require a down payment?If you want 100% financing, a VA loan is often the best option for qualified buyers.However, you'll need to be an active-duty servicemember or a veteran.You could also consider a USDA loan, which usually has no down payment requirement.To qualify, you must meet income restrictions and buy a house in a USDA-approved rural area.What is the lowest down payment for a mortgage?The lowest down payment on a mortgage is 0%.For that, you must be eligible for a VA or USDA loan, which requires having a military affiliation -- or a modest income and a property to buy in a rural and USDA-approved area.Is it dumb to buy a house with no down payment?No -- buying a house with no down payment can help you get your foot in the door as a homeowner, start building equity, and maybe even land a lower interest rate if you get a VA or USDA loan.However, you should be aware of the cons.No down payment means your mortgage payments will be higher, and you'll start out with 0% equity in your home.Methodology: Yahoo Finance reviews and scores mortgage lenders with quintile scoring in five primary categories: 1) Interest rates.Using 2024 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from almost 5,000 mortgage companies, we score mortgage lenders on issued mortgage rates below or above the annual median of reporting lenders.A measure of loan product availability and the willingness of a lender to offer government-backed loans, low down payments, down payment assistance, and consideration of nontraditional credit.HMDA data is again analyzed, and lenders are rated based on total loan costs compared to the annual median.4) Rate transparency.The ability of a website user to obtain a mortgage interest rate estimate.We score lenders based on whether rates are enhanced with discount points or high credit score requirements, disclaimers revealing rate assumptions, sample advertised rates, and whether adjustable or no discount point rate estimates are available.An analysis of the educational material, calculators, and additional resources available to users.Review of Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) data on regulatory actions can trigger a penalty to the score of any lender with a consumer mortgage-related administrative or enforcement action within the past five years.Advertisers
