ETMarkets.com S Vaidyanathan, CFO, HDFC Bank, says the bank's Q1 aligns with past trends, experiencing a seasonal dip in third-party distribution fees, particularly in insurance.The cost of funds decreased by approximately 10 basis points, while loan yields dropped by 20-22 basis points due to market benchmark loans repricing faster.I want to understand your fee income part which on a year-on-year basis has increased to 76 billion.But quarter-on-quarter, there has been a decline.In fact, after September, it has remained over and above 81 billion.So, is it only seasonality or something else?S Vaidyanathan: The Q4 is typically quite strong in seasonality, particularly from third-party distribution fees.Normally, the season for insurance is quite high in the country around the January to March period and then it starts to pick up after the first quarter.So, the first quarter is low, and this year's first quarter has been in line with the past trends.Also, you mentioned the cost of funds.Your yield on assets have come down as well.The cost of funds has come down after a long time.How do you see them throughout the year, if you can give some kind of guidance?S Vaidyanathan: The cost of funds has come down about by 10 basis points or so in this quarter.The yield on loans has come down, call it about 20-22 basis points this quarter.There are market benchmark loans, which are the floating rate loans.These floating rate loans are repriced faster than the cost of funds pricing and that is why we are seeing a lead effect coming from yield going down.So it has to stabilise.From here, the rate has to stabilise.We saw one more rate reduction of 50 basis points from RBI in June and so that has to factor in fully yet.It is not fully factored in yet.Over the next quarter, it will factor that in.The cost of funds is a managed cost of funds and our bank and other banks determine and offer savings rates and time deposit rates appropriately.We competitively price these deposits, and the market has not fully priced in the reduction of the policy rates which is 100 basis points down from February to June.The cost of funds or the deposit rates have not yet fully factored in the 100 basis points and once that comes in, then we will have to wait and see based on the renewal tenors and the new bookings come in at the lower rate.There is a path for it and the path will be a few quarters out.You Might Also Like: HDFC Bank Q1 Results: PAT rises 12% YoY to Rs 18,155 crore, NII up 5%; special dividend of Rs 5 per share declared Corporate and wholesale book is showing muted growth.I want to get guidance on that front.What does the on-ground situation look like?S Vaidyanathan: It is very similar to what we talked about last time, that the larger corporates are quite liquid, highly rated and pretty strong on their balance sheet.That means the yield that one could get from that is lower and we have seen competition from certain segments of the financial system where the rates are pretty low.They offer very low rates and consequently while we like the quality, we have been selective in offering and waiting for the rates.At least the rates that the banks are offering to larger corporates are stable and even in this quarter, we have seen that while the credit spreads widened by between 10 and 15 basis points depending on a AA or a AAA, the loan yields have continued to come down.It is something that we manage on a close relationship basis with corporates to participate not just on lending as a value proposition but overall relationships which are non-fund based as well as employee and the SME segment distribution and supply chain segment, very holistic relationships.You Might Also Like: HDFC Bank shares gain 2% on 12% YoY profit jump.HDFC Bank announces first ever bonus share issue at 1:1 ratio (You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel) READ MORE NEWS ON HdfcBankHDFC BankS VaidyanathanCost Of FundsLoan YieldsQ1 ResultsCorporate BankingInsurance Distribution FeesFinancial Stability (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.Also, ETMarkets.com is now on Telegram.For fastest news alerts on financial markets, investment strategies and stocks alerts, subscribe to our Telegram feeds .)Subscriband Sensex Today.Top Trending Stocks: SBI Share Price, Axis Bank Share Price, HDFC Bank Share Price, Infosys Share Price, Wipro Share Price, NTPC Share Price ...more
