+ You could save quite a bit on upcoming travel plans if you qualify for a credit card sign-up bonus offered by a travel card.In addition, travel cards have benefits that can help you save money over time, not just with an introductory offer.What are travel credit cards, and how do they work?A travel credit card is a rewards credit card that works similarly to a traditional credit card.The difference is that its reward structure benefits frequent travelers.These cards offer rewards -- typically as points or miles -- to holders who use them to pay for travel-related costs like flights, hotels, and car rentals.Once you have enough, you can redeem your points or miles to save on future travel expenses.The catch: These rewards and perks can come with an added cost.Travel credit cards may charge a higher annual fee than credit cards that don't offer the same type of rewards.The upside: Many travel cards reward new cardholders with a generous sign-up bonus.For example, this is what you can earn with the Chase Sapphire Preferred®️ Card: Learn more Chase Sapphire Preferred®️ Card Welcome offer Earn 75,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 in the first 3 months How can travel credit cards help you save on travel expenses?In general, there are three ways you can use travel credit cards to save money on travel.Welcome offers Most travel rewards credit cards offer a welcome bonus to eligible new cardholders.You typically have to spend a certain amount, often between $2,000 to $5,000, on your new card in the first three to six months from account opening to earn the welcome bonus.Considering that welcome offers can provide loads of rewards points or miles, this is an easy way to immediately boost your earnings, especially if you can earn the bonus through everyday purchases and expenses.You can use points or miles earned from a welcome bonus toward flights, hotel stays, or other travel redemptions.Everyday rewards Rewards credit cards earn points, miles, or cash back on purchases.Since most people have plenty of everyday expenses, such as gas and groceries, this is an ideal way to earn rewards on purchases you already make.And you can use any rewards you earn to help cover the costs of your next trip.Perks and benefits Some travel cards provide useful benefits that can cover or discount common travel purchases.For example, having airport lounge access may not only give you a comfortable area to wait for your flight, but it could also cover the cost of eating and drinking at the airport.Depending on the card, you might also be able to waive checked bag fees, receive free nights at hotels, use dining credits, and more.Waiving checked bag fees can quickly add up in savings if you take multiple round-trip flights per year.Related: How I used credit card perks and rewards for a once-in-a-lifetime trip to Japan and South Korea 8 travel credit card perks that can help you save money Many travel credit cards have annual fees, but their benefits can more than offset the cost.Some of the most valuable and common perks include: 1. Waived or discounted baggage fees Bag fees can be costly if you travel frequently.While certain airlines won't charge passengers for their first bag, this isn't the case across the board.On average, travelers can expect to pay around $30 for their first bag and, in many cases, more for additional bags.For larger families or groups, luggage costs can quickly add up.The good news is that many travel cards offer free checked bags.Here are a few examples: 2. Rental car discounts and insurance On average, a car rental in the United States can run about $55 per day, according to data from kayak.com.Fortunately, a travel credit card can help you earn enough points or cash back to pay for part of or all of your car rental.Many car rental companies require renters to have a rental insurance policy in place for the duration of their reservation to cover any damages, accidents, or theft.In some cases, this can come at an added cost of up to $15 per day or more.While your existing auto insurance policy may extend to your rental car, credit cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred®️ Card, Chase Sapphire Reserve®️, and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card all include rental car insurance for you to fall back on.Related: Which credit cards offer primary rental car insurance for your next trip?3. Travel insurance and trip cancellation If you don't have a travel insurance policy, any unforeseen illness or emergency could throw your plans off course, and you could lose most or all of the money you've spent on trip expenses.According to AAA, travel insurance policies usually cost around 5% to 10% of the entire trip cost.While these policies can help you save in an emergency, paying a premium to protect your trip is still an added expense that can add up, depending on your travel plans.Some credit cards offer travel insurance and trip cancellation coverage as an added benefit.That way, you won't lose out on all the money you've spent if your travel plans fall through.Many travel insurance policies also cover lost or delayed baggage, missed connections, trip delays or interruptions, medical evacuations if you require treatment, and accidental death.Related: How credit card protections work 4.Airport lounge access When you're making your way through a crowded airport, lounges provide a comfortable space to wait for boarding to begin.Many lounges offer complimentary snacks and beverages that can help you avoid paying a premium for your pre-flight snacks, free Wi-Fi and workspaces, showers to freshen up before a flight, napping rooms, and more.American Express, Capital One, and Chase all offer credit cards with airport lounge access, including these options: 5.

when entering the United States.You have to pay application fees for these programs, but thankfully, several credit cards, including the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card, Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, and the Chase Sapphire Reserve®️, can help you save on this extra cost.| Here are the steps you need to take to get TSA PreCheck for free 6.Flight and hotel upgrades You may be able to use your credit card points or miles to cover all or a portion of the cost of a flight or hotel upgrade.Say you want to upgrade to a business class seat, or you'd prefer a deluxe hotel room instead of a standard room, if you've booked your reservations through your card's travel portal or you redeem those rewards for a statement credit, you could make your travel plans a bit more enjoyable without having to front the entire cost.Related: Delta SkyMiles®️ Reserve American Express Card review -- Enjoy complimentary upgrades and lounge access 7.Hotel stays Applying for a travel

travel card can help you save is on purchases you make abroad.You might see a foreign transaction fee when you make a purchase outside the U.S. or from a foreign merchant, usually 1%-3% per transaction, although not all cards charge it.Many travel card issuers anticipate that cardholders will use their cards overseas and don't charge a fee as an added money-saving perk.| Check out our list of the best credit cards with no foreign transaction fees How to select a travel credit card When selecting a travel credit card, there are a few key factors to consider to pick the right card.Your travel habits and loyalty programs If you're a creature of habit and generally stick to the same hotels and airlines when you travel, it may not be a bad idea to get a co-branded credit card through your favorite hotel or airline.A co-branded credit card offered by one of the major issuers in partnership with your preferred hotel or airline can help you save through exclusive discounts and rewards.If you pair your travel credit card with the discounts and rewards offered by your favorite brand's loyalty program, you can double your savings.Related: Best airline credit cards The cost of a new card While rewards cards can help you save, your credit card company may charge you a higher annual fee for all these added perks and benefits.If the annual fee can pay for itself through the savings you'll be able to take advantage of, getting a travel card may be worth it.Say you often travel for work and can earn rewards for those frequent trips.However, if you're not a regular traveler and won't be able to fully reap the rewards of your card, an annual fee can put extra pressure on your budget.It's also important to make note of any limits your card issuer has on the amount of rewards you can earn within a given period, and select a card that gives you the most significant earning potential and money-saving rewards at the lowest cost.Adding a new credit card to your wallet can also significantly impact your credit score and your finances.Taking stock of how many cards you currently own, whether your budget allows for another minimum payment, and how much you stand to save based on your spending habits can help you decide if a new card will help or hurt you in the long run.Related: Best no-annual-fee credit cards Are you eligible for a travel credit card?Travel
