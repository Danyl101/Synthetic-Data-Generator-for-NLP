ETMarkets.com Enforcement Directorate searched Anil Ambani's properties.This relates to a Rs 3,000 crore loan fraud case involving Yes Bank.Shares of two of Anil Ambani's key companies, Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power, fell up to 4% on Thursday, July 24, after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted searches at dozens of premises linked to the businessman in connection with an ongoing probe into an alleged Rs 3,000 crore loan fraud involving Yes Bank.Reliance Power shares declined as much as 4.1% to Rs 60.25 on the BSE, while Reliance Infrastructure slid 3.5% to Rs 365.80 in intraday trade.ED raids in Rs 3,000 crore loan fraud case The ED on Thursday raided 40 to 50 locations connected to Anil Ambani as part of its investigation into suspected money laundering tied to loans sanctioned by Yes Bank between 2017 and 2019.The agency said these loans, worth around Rs 3,000 crore, were allegedly diverted to shell companies and other group entities.The searches are being conducted under Section 17 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).The probe follows two FIRs registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and is based on information provided by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the National Housing Bank, Bank of Baroda, and the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA).Evidence of diversion and regulatory lapses According to the ED, preliminary findings suggest serious lapses in Yes Bank's credit approval process, including back-dated documentation, disbursement of loans on or before approval dates, and absence of due diligence.Loans were allegedly granted to entities with weak financials and overlapping directorships, raising red flags over violations of lending norms and potential evergreening of accounts.Investigators have also uncovered indications of possible bribery involving Yes Bank officials, including the bank's promoter, in facilitating the loans.Sebi flags Reliance Home FinanceThe scope of the investigation includes over 50 companies and 25 individuals.Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has submitted separate findings related to Reliance Home Finance Ltd (RHFL), highlighting that the company's corporate loan book more than doubled within a year, an anomaly that raised concerns over internal control failures and regulatory breaches.The broader fallout of the raids and the ongoing probe weighed on investor sentiment surrounding Anil Ambani-led group entities on Thursday, triggering a sell-off in both Reliance Infra and Reliance Power shares.Companies respond to ED action In separate exchange filings, both Reliance Infrastructure and Reliance Power dismissed any connection with the transactions under investigation, stating that the enforcement actions have no operational or financial impact on their businesses.The companies said the reports "appear to pertain to allegations concerning transactions of Reliance Communications Limited (RCOM) or Reliance Home Finance Limited (RHFL) which are over 10 years old," adding that both Reliance Power and Reliance Infrastructure are (is) "a separate and independent listed entity with no business or financial linkage to RCOM or RHFL."Both the companies emphasized that Anil Ambani is not on their board and that any action taken against RCOM or RHFL "has no bearing or impact on the governance, management, or operations of Reliance Power."The companies said that the ED's actions "have absolutely no impact on the business operations, financial performance, shareholders, employees, or any other stakeholders of Reliance Infrastructure."Also read | ED raids nearly 50 sites linked to Anil Ambani in Rs 3,000 cr Yes Bank loan fraud probe (Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.These do not represent the views of the Economic Times)(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel)READ MORE NEWS ON YesBankReliance InfrastructureReliance PowerAnil AmbaniReliance InfraReliance PowerEd RaidsYes Bank FraudLoan DiversionYes Bank Loan Fraud Investigation(What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.Also, ETMarkets.com is now on Telegram.For fastest news alerts on financial markets, investment strategies and stocks alerts, subscribe to our Telegram feeds .)Subscriband Sensex Today.Top Trending Stocks: SBI Share Price, Axis Bank Share Price, HDFC Bank Share Price, Infosys Share Price, Wipro Share Price, NTPC Share Price ...more
