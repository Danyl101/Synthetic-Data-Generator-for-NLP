+ 00:00 Speaker A Tesla shares lower after reporting a slight earnings and revenue miss in the second quarter.Tesla reported Q2 revenue of 22.5 billion, compared to 22.64 billion estimated, which represented a 9% drop compared with the 25.05 billion reported a year ago.Tesla posted adjusted EPS of 40 cents versus 42 with operating income coming in at 923 million versus the 1.23 billion expected.The EV maker did announce its more affordable model was still slated for the second half of 2025 production.Tesla's future success could ride on CEO Elon Musk's next moves inside and outside of the company.We're taking a forward look at what that future could look like.Joining us now is Kareem Bousta.He is a former Vice President at both Tesla and Lift, and is also co-founder and managing director of DVX Ventures.It's a venture capital firm and company creation platform.Uh first Kareem, just listen as a as a former Tesla employee, your reaction to the results, Kareem.What do you make of the report?Kareem Bousta Well, I think this is confirming a trajectory that we've seen for the first few quarters, the last few quarters, which is a trajectory of declining sales, double digit decline in sales, double digit decline in profit, and this is happening in a in a EV market that is growing double digit in the globally.So, so I think this is this is concerning in terms of the trajectory that is that the company seems to be on.And the biggest concern to be honest is the fact that the the only way to get out of this, out of this cycle and and change the trajectory is going back, is for the company to go back to what has been made it successful in the past, which is to launch and build amazing products that customers love.So we're still seeing, we're still expecting announcements with regards to a new product, the lower cost vehicle, not a lot of details, but I really think this is one of the things that could take at least the the automotive business out of out of this trajectory and into a more positive future.04:43 Speaker A When we do talk to Bulls on the stock Kareem, and we talk about their product portfolio and what's ahead, some of them are more optimistic because of the revamped Model Y, because of that new affordable model on the way, they see better days ahead for deliveries.What do you make of that argument?Kareem Bousta Well, I think you have to look at the world as it is today, very different than even four or five years ago where Tesla was a clear leader, clear innovator, disruptor.In the meantime, competition has caught up.We're seeing every month's new models, new products being announced.We're seeing a lot of competitors being very successful, launching products that show tremendous growth with a lot of innovation and and frankly something that Tesla was the leader in, which I call the customer love.So customers enjoying and loving these products.We see it with American manufacturers, European manufacturers, Chinese, Korean, etc.So it's a very different situation than we had a few years ago when when Tesla was ahead of everybody.Now they're they're having to play catch up on on all fronts, and that makes it really hard because of the quality of the competition out there.07:06 Speaker A And Kareem, when you talked about competition, you mentioned you mentioned China there.There was this comment Kareem, I don't know if you saw this from from Ford's Jim Farley.And he was talking about the Chinese EV market, Kareem, and he of course has made a bunch of trips over there to China, and he said, it's the most humbling thing I have ever seen.They have far superior in vehicle technology.What do you make of those comments, Kareem?Do you agree with them?I I have to say I agree.I was I was at Tesla at the time when we were launching Tesla in China, and at the time the Chinese was exactly the opposite.Chinese were very humbled and they were learning and observing and looking at this technology that was brought in by by by Tesla.And it's been very impressive, incredibly impressive to see how quickly they caught up on all aspects.The hardware, the software, the charging infrastructure, the battery technology and also the manufacturing.So Tesla now has an edge has an advantage on all these things, including manufacturing, but the manufacturing advantage is not only anymore just with because of the labor.It's also because of the technology, the automation, the robots they have implemented, and they continue innovating.So it's very impressive to see and I must say that I agree with that comment that China has made incredible progress and has clearly become the strongest competition out there.10:12 Speaker A Kareem, I'll end here.You know, we mentioned how you used to work at Tesla, and I think a lot of Tesla investors, their hope is Kareem that Musk is now back full-time at Tesla, that he is, you know, full-time focused and attentive to Tesla.Do you think that will be the case, Kareem?Kareem Bousta It's hard for me to say if it's going to be the case.I'm no longer at the company, not looking at it on a day-to-day basis, but I think it is clearly the best thing that could have happened to the company, having Elon back at doing what he's what he's proved over the time that he's so good at creating amazing visions, strategies, focusing on products, developing products and solutions that customers love, combining innovation withre all the things that the company needs at this time, whether it's for the core automotive business or for the new robotaxi business that the company is working on.
