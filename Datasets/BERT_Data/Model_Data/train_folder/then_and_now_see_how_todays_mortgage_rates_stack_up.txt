affect mortgage interest rates, and here are some of the most common: Federal funds rate: Mortgage rates typically increase when the Fed rate increases and decrease when the Fed rate decreases.10-year Treasury yield: Because mortgages are longer-term loans, their rates follow the 10-year Treasury yield's movements even more than shorter-term yields (like the fed funds rate).Inflation: You'll
