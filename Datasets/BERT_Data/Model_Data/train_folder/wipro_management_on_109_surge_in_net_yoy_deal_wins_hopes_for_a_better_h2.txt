Iyer and Chief HR Officer Saurabh Govil during a press conference at Wipro Campus in Bengaluru (ANI Photo) Srini Pallia, CEO, Aparna Iyer, CFO, and Saurabh Govil, CHRO, Wipro in conversation with ET Now.Wipro CEO Srini Pallia highlights that Q1 performance was driven by a $5 billion order book, including a significant $2.75 billion from a large deal and two mega deals.The company's focus is now on executing these wins and proactively pursuing new opportunities in a robust pipeline.Based on current bookings, Wipro anticipates a stronger second half of the year.CFO Aparna Iyer pointed out that Wipro's net profits actually grew 10.9% year-on-year.This was after absorbing a restructuring charge in Q1, a strong performance over last eight quarters.There has been a decline in the IT services dollar revenue by about three-tenth of a percent on a sequential basis.How do you plan to address the challenges that you have at your hand right now?Srini Pallia: If you look at it from a Q1 performance perspective, if you look at the order book, we had a $5-billion order book, out of which $2.75 billion came in from a large deal and out of the 16 large deals, we had two mega deals and one potential mega deal.What is important for us at this point in time as an organisation is to stay focused and make sure we execute these deal wins that we have.Second, we continue to have a very strong pipeline and what we need to do is make sure we are very proactive with the clients in winning these new sets of opportunities that we have in the pipeline.Having said that, based upon the bookings that we already have, for us the second half definitely is much better than the first half and that is the optimism we are looking at right now.Thanks to Trump tariffs and a lot of other global economic issues, a lot of uncertainties are prevailing, especially in the manufacturing sectors, right now.What are your views on it and how is it impacting your business currently?Srini Pallia: You make a very important point here, there is macroeconomic uncertainty and it continues at this point in time.Of course, there is also the concept of geopolitics.So, the impact of these two varies from country to country.If I were to look at my pipeline, if I look at the demand that we have, Americas, Europe, and APMEA - the three large regions - have a very strong pipeline and if I were to break it by sectors, if you look at the banking and financial services at this point in time, the deal pipeline is strong and we also want two mega deals in this particular business.If you look at the kind of pipeline that we have, it is a combination of both cost optimisation and vendor consolidation on one hand, and on the other, the clients are investing in modernisation, data, and AI.So, the pipeline clearly reflects that in the banking and financial services sector around that.Similarly, if you look at technology and communications, we won a potential mega deal.There, the clients are very clearly trying to invest in AI and that they can upgrade their software and platforms, that is the journey that they are on and it is an opportunity for us.Healthcare continues to be very good for us over the period of time and while the payers have a constant challenge around the cost, the digital transformation aspects of it continues.If you look at the consumer business and the EMR business, we have softness there because of tariffs.Retail, CPG, and manufacturing are the three industry sectors that have got impacted by the tariffs.But having said that, if you look at deal wins in Q1, we have had some good deal wins in retail and that would actually give us the momentum going into next quarter.Manufacturing continues to be soft for us, but we are looking at proactively working with the clients in helping on the cost takeout aspects.So, net-net, there is good deal momentum in Q1, and a good pipeline for us to stay focused in Q2 and execute.You just touched upon your deal bookings and there has been a 24% uptick.Your large deal bookings have come in at an increase of nearly 50% on a sequential basis.Which business segment is growing and when can we expect these deal conversions to reflect on your top line?Srini Pallia: As an organisation, our focus is to make sure we execute these deals.Some of these deals will take time.For example, if you look at the Phoenix deal that we announced in Q4, the actual ramp up and revenue will come in Q3 for us.Similarly, we are working on some of the mega deals and that is the reason why I said the second half looks much better than where we are in the first half because these deals will start getting executed by the team.I want to talk about profitability.Your PAT has seen a downtick of about 6.7%.Tell me what financial strategy are you implementing to try and better your bottom line?Aparna Iyer: Net profits actually grew 10.9% year-on-year, so that is a very strong performance.This is after absorbing a restructuring charge that we took in Q1.It is a very strong performance over the last eight quarters.We have consistently improved margins.At 17.3% it is still an 80 basis points improvement year-on-year.Gen-AI and consulting, what upskilling measures are going on in the company right now for readiness at the workforce level?Any particular number related to Gen-AI trained workforce?Deep, deep work is happening to raise the capability of the entire organisation on Gen-AI.The first step is everybody, starting from Srini down to everybody in the company, have been trained one-on-one on Gen-AI.Now, we are working on level two and level three depending on the depth and technical areas which people want to get into.We have also tied up with a large number of our partners to give this training to our people.So, from a supply side perspective, we are gearing ourselves very clearly to make sure as and when the demand comes we are ready for that.Apart from that for certain key skills, certain experienced people required by the clients on the deals which we have done, we are also going and hiring in the market.So, it is both a build approach and a buy approach to manage the situation.We have gone through these cycles earlier whenever the technology has changed and from the supply side, we are comfortable to manage any demand which would come in this area.With a Marelli bankruptcy episode behind you, are you reassessing your client concentration risk in the manufacturing vertical?Aparna Iyer: There are certain sectors that are obviously a little bit more stressed compared to the others.It has always been the case.The auto sector for now is going through a lot of stress and we saw one of our clients impacted.But we made an assessment and we have taken a financial impact accordingly, but we continue to work with them very closely.It still remains a very important relationship for us.Manufacturing overall has been soft and if you look at it, manufacturing as a percentage of our revenues is quite small compared to some of the other sectors.BFSI is about 33% and consumer is about 18%.Actually, energy and manufacturing collectively is about 18%; manufacturing is a smaller component in that.We are not unduly worried about the concentration risk that we have towards either the sector or any one particular client, but we remain focused.That is something we remain close to and keep monitoring and take actions which are related to risk management.What about the currency fluctuations?How have they impacted the quarter and any specific plans that you may have to try and mitigate the volatility?Aparna Iyer: We have a very good foreign exchange risk management policy and framework in place.We have been very consistent and the results have proved very favourably even over the last several years and we have continued to maintain it.We are not unduly worried about the volatility but yes, that is something that needs to be managed and we have a very good framework and policy to manage it.What growth prospects are you currently looking at when it comes to your consulting side?Srini Pallia: We called out that consulting-led AI powered is a Wipro strategy.As part of that, we have Capco which is very strong in the BFSI segment.In fact, Capco has grown 6% year-on-year and relative to Wipro, it's a very strong performance and they are actually the tip of the spear for us as we do the downstream revenue for Wipro.In addition, we have also built a strong consulting team across other sectors as well.So, the conversations that we have had, especially in the deal wins that we did in Q1, were all consulting-led because it is very important to understand the customer business.For that, we need to have the domain capabilities, understand the process, and the data while infusing AI into that.So, net-net it is a good story for us.What are your priorities when it comes to capital allocation and investments in the coming quarter?Any new leasing plan or special AI lab?Aparna Iyer: From a capital allocation standpoint, we raised our capital allocation policy of returning 70% and above of the net profits over a cumulative three-year period and we also gave out a dividend of Rs 6 per share in January.We are very pleased to announce that the board has actually approved an interim dividend of Rs 5 this quarter, so that will make it a cumulative payout of about nearly $1.3 billion over the last six months.We are happy to have raised the capital allocation policy and we are executing on it.Any specific level in attrition that you would be targeting for the next few quarters and any major reasons that you feel are responsible for attrition at Wipro?Saurabh Govil: In the last three-four quarters, we have been around 15% attrition, plus-minus 0.1-0.2% and fairly comfortable with this from a supply side and demand.There are seeing spikes in some pockets like GCCs or in some skills but overall, I think we will be in this range of attrition going forward which we are very comfortable with.(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel) READ MORE NEWS ON Wipro ManagementWipro CEO Srini
