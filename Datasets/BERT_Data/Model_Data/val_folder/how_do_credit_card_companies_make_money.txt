+ Great credit cards offer valuable rewards and benefits -- but those perks aren't free.Credit card companies have multiple revenue streams from the cards they issue, such as interest charges, credit card fees, and processing fees for the transactions you make.Here's more about how credit card companies make money today and how you can minimize the amount you pay for your cards.Read more: Best rewards credit cards for 2025 Credit card networks vs. issuers To understand how credit card companies make money, it's important to understand how your card works.Every credit card account you hold has both a credit card network and a credit card issuer.Credit card network: A credit card network is the company that connects merchants and financial institutions issuing the cards.The network authorizes and settles credit card transactions.In the United States, there are four major credit card networks: American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa.Credit card issuer: Issuers are banks, credit unions, or other financial institutions that provide cards directly to customers.Credit card issuers review your application, determine credit card account terms, and set your credit limit.According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) , there are nearly 4,000 issuing banks and financial institutions in the United States, though most accounts are held with a few top issuers.The largest issuers include American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citi, and Discover.For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred®️ Card is issued by Chase but operates on the Visa network, while the Blue Cash Preferred®️ Card from American Express is both issued by American Express and on the American Express network.As a consumer, you may never think about the process involved in making a purchase with a credit card.But there are many steps that happen to complete a credit card transaction.When you make a purchase online or in person, the retailer sends a request to the credit card issuer through the specific credit card network.When the issuer receives the transaction, it approves or denies it and responds through the network.Once this process is complete, the retailer receives payment for the amount of the transaction.The whole process takes just seconds.How do credit card companies make money?Credit cards can be extremely profitable for financial institutions.In fact, these companies charged consumers over $130 billion in 2022, according to the CFPB .Those consumer costs include interest and fees paid on card accounts.But credit card companies also make money from transactions.Here's a closer look at how each of these work: 1. Interest payments When you carry a balance on a credit card you'll accrue interest on that balance.Any interest you take on must be paid to your credit card issuer, and interest income is a valuable source of revenue for credit card companies.Of the $130 billion that credit card users paid to credit card companies in 2022, over $105 billion came from interest payments, the CFPB report shows.That's because credit card interest charges are very high.The average annual percentage rate (APR) for credit cards that assessed interest is currently around 22.25%.How does that affect your repayment?Consider this example: Jane has a $1,000 balance on a credit card at 22.25% APR, and her minimum monthly payment is $30.If she only pays the minimum each month, it would take her 53 months to pay off her card, and she'd pay a total of $1,559.61.The card's APR would cause her to repay more than $571 in interest charges to her credit card issuer.Read more: Pay down existing debt without interest using a balance transfer credit card .2. Interchange When you use a credit card to make a transaction, a series of steps happen behind the scenes to get the money from your card's issuing bank to the merchant's bank.Merchants must also pay a fee for each transaction to cover the processing costs.This fee is known as an interchange fee or swipe fee; it often ranges from 1% to 3% of the transaction amount.As a cardholder, you aren't responsible for these fees, but they can cost you indirectly.Because interchange fees come out of the retailer's pocket, some may give you a discount for using cash or require you spend a minimum amount to pay with a credit card.For banks, interchange fees are substantial and can help cover the cost of rewards programs that you use to earn points or get benefits on your spending.Fee income Credit card companies can also make money from the additional fees they charge cardholders.Here are a few examples: Annual fees: Some cards, particularly premium travel or rewards cards , charge annual fees .Users pay the fee even if they don't use the card, so it's a consistent source of income for credit card issuers.The highest annual fees can cost over $700 each year.Balance transfer fees: When you transfer a balance from one credit card account to another, you have to pay a balance transfer fee .This is either a standard dollar amount or a percentage of the balance you transfer.Balance transfer fees vary by card, but they're generally 3% to 5% of the transfer amount.Cash advance fees: You can tap into your credit limit to get an upfront lump sum of cash, but you'll have to pay your credit card issuer a fee for the privilege.The cash advance fee is typically 5% of the advance amount or $10, whichever is greater.Foreign transaction fees: You must pay a foreign transaction fee on most cards when you use your card while traveling in another country or making purchases online in foreign currency.Foreign transaction fees typically cost around 2% to 3% of the transaction amount, though many travel credit cards waive these fees.Late payment fees: When you miss a payment due date -- even if you're just a few hours late -- the card issuer will charge you a late fee.Card issuers determine their own fees, but some charge as much as $41.Related: Credit card fees explained -- 8 types you should know 5 ways to reduce your credit card costs Now that you know how credit card companies make money, you can change how you use your card and manage your credit to reduce how much you pay in interest and fees.These are a few steps you can take today: 1. Pay your statement balance in full Credit cards typically have a grace period -- several days between when your billing statement closes and your payment is due.If you pay off the statement balance in full by the due date, no interest accrues, and you won't have to pay any interest charges to the issuer.Paying your balance in full by the due date every month is the best way to avoid high-interest credit card debt .2. Choose a card without an annual fee Not all credit cards charge annual fees .Many rewards cards are available without annual fees, so you can still earn valuable cash back, points, or airline miles without paying fees.Here are a few examples of no annual fee cards that earn rewards across different programs today: Read more: Best credit cards with no annual fee 3.Avoid cash advances Cash advances may be a helpful last resort in an emergency , but you should avoid them whenever possible.Although a cash advance may seem like an easy and convenient way to get money upfront, they can be extremely costly.Not only will you have to pay a cash advance fee on the amount advanced, you'll also have to pay a higher APR on the advance.4. Set up payment remindersLate fees can be costly.And when you miss a credit card payment , some issuers will raise your APR to the penalty APR -- a substantially higher rate, so more interest accrues faster.Missing payments can also have a negative effect on your credit score .Set up payment reminders on your phone or calendar so you don't forget, or sign up for automatic payments for at least the minimum owed.5. Improve your credit If you improve your credit score , you can qualify for cards with lower fees and interest rates.You may even be able to reduced APR to retain you as a customer.To bolster your credit, aim to keep your credit card balances as low as possible and make all your monthly payments on time.
