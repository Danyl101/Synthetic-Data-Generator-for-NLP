I am bullish on Bank Nifty.It is currently in a consolidation zone, with immediate resistance around 57,400.Strong resistance is seen in the 56,250-56,400 range.On this correction, one can consider creating long positions, as the weekly and monthd to a 1,000-point rally.Accumulate Bank Nifty on dips, but keep a stop loss below 56,250.For Nifty, it's better to wait for a breakout above 25,300 before entering,
