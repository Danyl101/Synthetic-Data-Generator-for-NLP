mortgage providers you choose, compare loan offers, and submit a final application for approval.Lenders structure the loans to meet FHA standards so that the government can insure the mortgage.That protects lenders from exposure to defaults, allowing them to make more loans and secure their working capital.FHA loans are subject to FHA mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs) paid for by the borrower.Tips for comparing FHA lenders Look for lenders that offer the best combination of low interest rates and minimal fees.They should also have helpful, respectful personnel who clearly guide you through the loan process and show they want your business.Use a mortgage calculator to determine how much of a monthly payment you can afford.Check your credit report and credit score so that you know your creditworthiness.You'll need at least a 580 credit score to qualify for an FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.Many credit card companies and financial institutions offer free credit score access.Consider various mortgage loan types to find out which one is best for you.FHA loans are great options, but you might find an even better fit.Determine how much down payment you can make.You only need 3.5% down for an FHA loan, but if you put down 10%, you can qualify with a 500 credit score and automatically remove FHA mortgage insurance after 11 years.Shop multiple lenders and compare loan offers.Pay close attention to the annual percentage rate you are offered.Select your best offer and get an official mortgage preapproval.FHA loan closing costs The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates that FHA loan closing costs usually equal around 3% to 4% of the home sales price.For a $500,000 house, that would come to $15,000 to $20,000.Many of the closing costs are the same as those for a conventional loan, such as an appraisal fee, inspection fee, and charges for a title search and title insurance.The main difference is the FHA mortgage insurance premium (MIP).FHA mortgage insurance FHA loans require mortgage insurance regardless of how much you put down.FHA mortgage insurance premiums (MIPs) have two parts: An up-front mortgage insurance premium (UFMIP) is due on closing day.An ongoing annual MIP is paid in monthly installments with your mortgage payment.The UFMIP payment is set at 1.75% of the mortgage loan amount.Your ongoing MIP cost depends on various factors, including the mortgage principal, loan-to-value ratio, and loan term length.You can remove FHA mortgage insurance after 11 years if you made a down payment of 10% or more when you bought the home.Pros and cons of FHA loans Pros Low down payment: If you have a 580 credit score, you only need a 3.5% down payment to get an FHA loan.Some conforming loans require 5% or more, and you'll probably need 10% to 20% down for a jumbo loan.Low credit score requirement: You only need a 500 credit score to qualify for an FHA loan if you have a 10% down payment.Otherwise, you're eligible with a 580 score and 3.5% down payment.Higher debt-to-income ratio (DTI):Typically, mortgage lenders approve you for an FHA loan with a 43% DTI ratio.Many conventional loans cap your DTI at 41%.However, both FHA and conventional loan lenders may offer flexibility, so it's important to shop for lenders and loan types.Competitive mortgage rates: FHA loans usually have lower interest rates than conventional mortgages.Cons Property requirements: The property you're buying must meet the minimum property standards set by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and a home appraiser will check that the home abides by these rules when they visit the house.Loan limits: You can't borrow as much with an FHA loan as with a conforming conventional loan.In 2025, the conforming loan limit for a single-unit property is $806,500 in most parts of the U.S, and the FHA loan limit is $524,225.Mortgage insurance: Unlike VA and USDA loans, FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums throughout the life of the loan.It's also not nearly as easy to cancel FHA MIPs as it is with conventional loan private mortgage insurance (PMI).Dig deeper: Pros and cons of FHA loans Alternatives to FHA loans FHA vs. conventional loans FHA loans are well-suited for borrowers with credit scores as low as 500 to 580.However, if your credit score is 620 or higher, you may qualify for a conventional loan.Two conventional mortgage programs, HomeReady and Home Possible, are also targeted at home buyers with limited savings, offering down payments as low as 3%.That even edges out the FHA minimum down payment of 3.5%.Some lenders offer the same conventional loan programs but reduce the required down payment to 1%.To find the lenders that offer a 1% down program, check out Yahoo Finance's best lenders for first-time homebuyers.Dig deeper: FHA vs. conventional loan -- Which should you choose?FHA vs. VA loans As good as FHA loans are, they really can't compete with loans backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs.For military service-connected borrowers, VA loans are most often your best bet.That's because VA loans usually require no down payment or mortgage insurance, and they put a limit on closing costs.A VA mortgage is a valuable benefit available to current service members, veterans, and eligible surviving spouses.Learn more: FHA vs. VA loans FHA vs. USDA loans USDA home loans sound like they would be meant exclusively for farm and ranch properties.However, while most qualifying areas are rural, some suburban areas are also included.FHA loan amounts depend on local property values, but mortgages backed by the USDA (U.S. Department of Agriculture) are capped by household income.While FHA loans are governed by county loan limits, USDA loans are meant to help low- to moderate-income households earning no more than 115% of the local median household income.Read more: FHA vs. USDA loans FHA lenders that did not make our best FHA lender list We seriously considered the following mortgage lenders with FHA loans for our best-of list, but they weren't quite as strong as our top picks: FHA lender FAQs What is an FHA loan, and who qualifies?An FHA loan is a government-backed mortgage designed for low- to moderate-income households.With a lower credit score threshold, borrowers may qualify with a credit score of 500 with a 10% down payment or 580 with 3.5% down.What will disqualify you from an FHA loan?You may not qualify for an FHA loan if your credit score is below 500, you are delinquent on any federal debt (including student loans) or have a federal lien on your assets, or you have a debt-to-income ratio (DTI) over 57% (though lenders can set their own maximum DTI).You do not have to be a U.S. citizen to qualify for an FHA loan.Still, you must have lawful permanent resident alien status or be a non-permanent resident alien with a valid Social Security number and eligible to work in the U.S.Is it hard is hard to get an FHA loan right now?Let's face it, no home loan is easy to get -- but FHA loans are the most flexible when it comes to qualifying.There will be a lot of paperwork, just as with all loans.You will also have to prove that you have a steady income and can make the monthly mortgage payment.The key is to ask questions, understand what you are signing, and prepare for an occasional bump in the road along the way.Do sellers avoid FHA buyers?A seller can refuse your offer for any reason, even if it is higher than someone else's offer.One reason sellers might avoid an FHA buyer is that FHA loans often have more stringent appraisal standards.A seller could be required to make repairs to meet those HUD property guidelines.FHA borrowers may also be unlikely to afford large earnest money deposits that entice sellers -- and FHA loans have a reputation for taking longer to close.Who is the largest FHA lender?Pennymac is the largest FHA lender by number of FHA loans issued, according to 2024 HMDA data.Are all FHA lenders the same?No, not all FHA lenders are the same.It's true that the Federal Housing Administration has guidelines for the credit score and down payment to qualify for an FHA loan.However, lenders can require higher eligibility standards and charge different interest rates and fees.What credit score is good for FHA loans?You can qualify for an FHA loan with a 500 credit score if you have a 10% down payment, or a 580 score with 3.5% down.However, as mentioned above, lenders may use "overlays" to require higher eligibility standards.What bank is best for FHA loans?The
