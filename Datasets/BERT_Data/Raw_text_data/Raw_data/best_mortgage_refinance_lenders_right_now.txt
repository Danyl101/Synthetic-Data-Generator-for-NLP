mortgage Mortgage refinancing is seeing a sharp uptick.According to the latest data from Fannie Mae, refinance applications are 31% higher year-over-year.The national average refinance APR (annual percentage rate) on a 30-year mortgage at the time of writing is 6.64%.For 15-year loans, it's down to 5.91%.There are many reasons to refinance.However, when you finally decide to exchange your old home loan for a new one, the lender you choose could be the most critical decision.When you think of mortgage refinancing, you may immediately focus on interest rates.But there are other reasons to replace your home loan with a new one.You may be looking to: Lower your monthly payment Eliminate mortgage insurance Change co-borrowers Adjust your payoff date Deciding to move ahead with a refinance requires some deliberation, information gathering, and goal setting.You'll also have to gather some documents that the lender will be looking for.Then, discuss those goals with two or three lenders to determine your best options.Types of mortgage refinancing As we've mentioned, there are several mortgage refinancing options.Let's take a quick look at the different types of refis.Rate-and-term refinance The rate-and-term refinance is the core refinance loan -- the one most people think of first.You replace your current mortgage with a new one that has a lower interest rate and perhaps a different repayment term length.The term (the length of time you wish to pay on the loan) is a choice you make when you structure your new loan.It can be shorter, longer, or the same as the payoff period of your existing mortgage.Cash-out refinance Two things happen as you live in a house for a while: You pay down the balance you owe, called the principal, and the value of your house (usually) grows.That means you'll have equity in your house.Typically, you can't access that value until you sell your home unless you get a second mortgage for a home equity loan or line of credit -- or a cash-out refinance.With a cash-out refi, you take some of the value of your home out in cash and add it back to your loan balance.Read more: Streamline refinance Government loans offer simpler forms of refinancing that take less time and have fewer paperwork hurdles to clear.Called streamline refinances, they are available to homeowners with FHA, VA, or USDA mortgages.bottom-line Dig deeper: No-closing-cost refinance Refinancing a loan is no small expense.If you don't have some cash set aside for the closing costs, you may want to look into a no-closing-cost refinance.The name of the loan is a little misleading, though."No closing cost" is not accurate.There are the usual lender and third-party fees that come with a refinance, but you don't pay them up-front.Instead, the expenses are added to your loan balance or baked into a higher interest rate.Cash-in refinance Here's a refi spin you may not be familiar with: a cash-in refinance.It's exactly what it sounds like, but you may wonder why it's a thing.How it works: You take a lump sum of cash, apply it to the loan principal as a down payment, and, in effect, shrink your mortgage.As a result, your new loan is likely to have a lower interest rate.You might even pay the loan off earlier and save even more interest.It can be an interesting option to explore if you've come into some cash and are looking for ways to put it to good use.Short refinance Another specialized refinance product is the short refinance.It's an emergency financial maneuver when you are so late on your mortgage payments that you are at risk of foreclosure.If you can convince your lender that you can make the payments on a restructured refinance, the lender agrees to a new loan for less than the original mortgage.There are credit history and tax consequences to consider, but if you're in a default danger zone, it may be a worthy resolution.Reverse mortgage Of the seven home refinance options, this may be the most innovative, particularly for seniors looking for a boost in financial security.For homeowners aged 62 and over who own their house or have it nearly paid off, a reverse mortgage generates an on-demand lump sum of cash or an income stream.You still own the home but don't make payments on the amount of equity withdrawn.Interest and fees accumulate over time as equity in the house is reduced.The loan balance is due when you no longer live there and is usually paid from the proceeds of a sale.In the meantime, there are closing costs, tax payments, and insurance premiums to pay.A reverse mortgage is a complicated transaction and requires careful consideration.Pros and cons of refinancing a mortgage The longer you live in a home, the more you may think about refinancing.It can be a tempting proposition.It is also a wealth-building move, if done for the right reasons.Here are the main pros and cons of refinancing a mortgage:Pros The potential to lower your interest rate The possibility of lowering your monthly payment The ability to pull cash out of your home's value The opportunity to pay off your house sooner Cons Lender and third-party fees that are included in the closing costs Paying more interest over the life of the loan if you extend the mortgage term The risk of adding to your debt load When it makes sense to refinance your mortgageSometimes it makes sense to refinance your home loan, and sometimes it doesn't.If you can improve your financial situation, a home loan refinance is a good idea.Hopefully, it's a long-term improvement.The most obvious good reason to refi is when
