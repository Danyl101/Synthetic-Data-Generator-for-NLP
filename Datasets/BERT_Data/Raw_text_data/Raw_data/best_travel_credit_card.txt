points and miles toward any type of travel.But if you always prefer flying with a certain airline or booking with a specific hotel chain, a co-branded travel card might be more rewarding.We included hotel and airline cards in our overall travel card ratings, and the cards below are the top-scoring options.Just remember: a co-branded travel card only makes sense if you fly often enough with that airline or stay frequently enough at the hotel to justify its value over a more general card.Make sure you look at your recent travel and any upcoming plans before deciding.Top-rated airline credit

spending, which you can use toward travel-related redemptions, such as flights, hotel stays, and car rentals.You'll often earn the highest rewards rate on travel purchases with a travel credit card, though many also offer boosted rewards on everyday purchases like groceries, gas, and more.Many travel cards also provide travel benefits and perks, which could include airport lounge access, annual travel or airline credits, companion airfare, or elite status with an airline or hotel loyalty program.Learn more about how travel credit cards work Is a travel card worth it?Travel credit cards are worth it if you get enough value from the card's benefits and rewards to outweigh any potential costs, such as an annual fee.Unlike some other rewards cards, like cash-back credit cards, travel cards are more likely to carry annual fees in exchange for their high rewards rates and annual benefits.They might not be worth it if you don't travel enough to take advantage of these card benefits and rewards.However, a travel card can still be worth it if you're not a frequent traveler.Even if you travel only once or twice per year, you can accumulate points throughout the year to offset your airfare and hotel costs when you do go on a trip.See if travel credit cards are worth it for you Types of travel credit cards When you're comparing travel credit cards, it can be useful to separate them into two distinct types: general travel rewards cards and co-branded airline and hotel credit cards.General travel rewards cards With a general travel credit card, you'll have a number of flexible redemption options when you're ready to redeem your points and miles.You may also have a broader range of benefits.Some general travel credit cards include: Chase Sapphire Preferred Card Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card American Express Gold Card Travel card issuers generally have their own travel portals, like Chase Travel or American Express Membership Rewards.You can use these to book flights, hotels, rental cars, and more.They may also have a number of travel partners, to which you can directly transfer points or miles.For example, American Express Membership Rewards points transfer to Delta SkyMiles at a rate of 1:1.Related: Amex points vs. Chase points --Who has the better rewards program?The flexibility of general travel cards means you can travel with any number of different airlines or hotel brands and get the best bang for your buck.Each time you're ready to book, simply shop around between the portal or partners and compare the best options for your specific travel plans.These credit cards also allow other redemption options, such as statement credits, gift cards, and cash back.But you'll generally get the best value by redeeming points or miles for travel.Airline and hotel credit cards Airline and hotel credit cards are typically co-branded between the card issuer and the airline or hotel chain.Here are a few examples: Alaska Airlines Visa Signature credit card United Quest Card Marriott Bonvoy Boundless Credit CardThese cards are best suited for travelers who prefer to fly with a specific airline or stay at a certain hotel chain.Maybe you live near a hub airport, frequent a destination where a specific airline offers the most direct flight options, or you enjoy the perks of a specific hotel's loyalty program.Instead of flexible rewards points or miles, you'll earn points or miles within the airline or hotel rewards program, like Marriott Bonvoy points or American Airlines AAdvantage miles -- and get a boosted rewards rate when you spend directly with the airline or hotel.These cards often offer a faster path to elite status tiers within these programs as well.You'll typically get the best redemption rate when you use rewards for flights with the airline or stays at a hotel, but many programs offer other redemptions, too.Some airline and hotel rewards programs may even allow you to transfer your points and miles to other travel partners like you can with general travel rewards programs.The added benefits of co-branded cards are designed to appeal to loyal airline or hotel customers.For example, your airline card may get you priority boarding, upgrades, free checked bags, and in-flight discounts.And your hotel card may offer early check-in or late checkout, annual free night awards, and on-site credits.Co-branded travel cards aren't for everyone, but they can add a lot to your travel experience if you have a strong airline or hotel preference.What to look for in a travel credit card Here are a few key details to look for in any new travel credit card: 1. Annual fee No matter your budget, there's a travel credit card with an annual fee that fits.You can find solid no annual fee options, like the U.S. Bank Altitude Connect Visa Signature card.But there are also plenty of premium travel cards with steep fees -- The Platinum Card®️ from American Express, for example, may set you back $695 per year (see rates and fees) but comes with an abundance of valuable benefits and perks that can potentially give you even more value back each year.The most important thing to keep in mind when deciding whether an annual fee is worth it for you is whether you can get enough out of the rewards and benefits to outweigh the cost -- without spending more than you otherwise would or can afford.Sign-up bonus For new cardholders, a sign-up bonus can offer major first-year value.These bonuses may be worth anything from 10,000 to over 100,000 bonus points or miles -- which can translate to hundreds of dollars in rewards value.However, you should compare the terms of the bonus to your own budget before you apply.For example, you may need to spend $4,000 within the first three months of opening your card before you can earn the 60,000 bonus points.If that's not within your typical spending, be careful not to take on debt to meet the spending threshold.Accruing high interest on balances can quickly outpace even the best bonus.One smart strategy is opening a new travel credit card when you're booking a trip you've been saving for.You may already be prepared to spend more than usual, which can help you reach the bonus requirement faster.Plus, you can earn rewards on those travel purchases to put toward future trips.Also look out for limited-time offers from top travel credit cards.Occasionally, issuers will increase the welcome bonus for a period of time -- if you see a promotional offer that fits within your budget, that could be a great time to apply for a new card.Rewards Rewards are one of the biggest reasons for many people to open a travel credit card.Earning rewards with travel cards often works in one of two ways.You'll either earn rewards on your everyday spending (groceries, gas stations, restaurants) to redeem toward future travel, or earn rewards on your travel spending to put toward future travel.Some cards offer a combination of these rewards, but knowing which type of spender you are can be useful.If your monthly budget is largely dedicated to everyday spending, you may get more value from the former.But if you travel frequently and spend a lot of money on flights, hotels, and rental cars, you can quickly rack up more points with travel-based rewards categories.4. Travel perks and benefits Many travel rewards credit cards -- especially the most premium cards with high annual fees -- really shine when it comes to added perks and benefits.These benefits can help you offset the annual fee and save money each time you travel.Take the $395 annual fee Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card, for example.Each year, you'll get a $300 annual credit for bookings through Capital One Travel and 10,000 bonus miles (equal to $100 towards travel) on your account anniversary.Already, that's enough to wipe out the annual cost -- before accounting for any rewards and other benefits (like up to $120 in fee credits toward TSA PreCheck or Global Entry and Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership).Just remember: Choose a card with benefits that help you save on purchases you would still have made otherwise.If you tend to arrive shortly before takeoff and don't care about airport lounge access, you won't actually get the $200 potential value from that benefit.5. Travel insurance and protections One unique aspect of travel credit cards is the protections you can get as a cardholder when you travel.Common protections offered by travel credit cards include trip cancellation and interruption insurance, car rental insurance, trip delay reimbursement, baggage delay insurance, access to emergency assistance services, and more.As long as you pay for your travel expenses with the card (booking flights, hotels, tours, etc.)you can qualify for these travel protection benefits.Like any coverage, though, you should make sure to read the fine print of what your
