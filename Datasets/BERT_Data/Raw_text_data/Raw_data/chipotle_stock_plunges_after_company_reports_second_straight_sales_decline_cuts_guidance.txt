+ Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) reported another quarter of falling sales, sending shares sharply lower on Thursday.The fast-casual restaurant chain posted results on Wednesday as it navigates an uncertain consumer environment and as its new leadership deals with the most challenging backdrop in years.Chipotle reported same-store sales fell 4% in the second quarter, more than the 2.9% decline Wall Street expected, according to Bloomberg data.Shares of Chipotle were down more than 12% before the bell.Traffic also fell more than expected, falling 4.9% against the 4.4% drop that had been forecast by the Street.That's an acceleration from the 2.3% drop seen in the first quarter, which marked Chipotle's first quarterly foot traffic decline since 2022.Chipotle also cut its guidance again, saying it now expects flat full-year same-store sales growth, compared to an increase in the low-single-digit range.Ahead of Wednesday's report, analysts expected same-store sales to grow 0.8% for the fiscal year.CEO Scott Boatwright told investors that "ongoing volatility in our trends in the consumer environment" prompted the company to cut its full-year same-store sales forecast.Earnings were in line with forecasts, tallying $0.33 per share on an adjusted basis.Revenue missed forecasts, coming in at $3.06 billion, below the $3.11 billion analysts had expected."We did see some share loss in the April-May time frame as the low-income consumer pulled back, but we're back to share gains yet again in June-July," Boatwright told investors on the company's earnings call.Boatwright added that the company is "trending along with the macro and consumer sentiment at this point, and so I don't have overarching fears."Still, the exec admitted he believes its perceived value proposition isn't translating to consumers in the same way it did this time last year."We've got to figure out a way we can communicate value for the consumer and showcase the value we are to QSR and fast casual," he said."There's more work to do there, and that's what we'll lean into in the back half of the year."Boatwright told investors the company expects to return to positive transaction growth in the second half of the year.Chipotle expects tariffs to raise its cost of sales by 0.5% on an ongoing basis, with the company forecasting an additional 0.4% impact in the third quarter.Chipotle sign hanging in an outdoor shopping corridor along Mount Diablo Boulevard in Lafayette, Calif., on May 12, 2025.(Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)* Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images In mid-June, the company launched Adobo Ranch, st Sharon Zackfia wrote in a note to clients prior to the report that this new item "seemed to yield both improved traffic and ticket given the associated upcharge."
