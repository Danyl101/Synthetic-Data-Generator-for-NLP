Coastal erosion threatens coconut groves in Nagigi village, Fiji, as rising sea levels driven by climate change reshape shorelines and disrupt marine-dependent livelihoods.Climate change threatens livelihoods in Nagigi villageNagigi village, located on Savusavu Bay in Vanua Levu, Fiji's second-largest island, is facing direct impacts from climate change.With a population of 630, Nagigi relies heavily on marine resources for food security and income.Residents have observed significant environmental shifts in recent years, including rising sea levels and fish scarcity."Tides are pushing inland.Once abundant, fish are now harder to find.Sandy beaches and coconut trees have been washed away," one villager noted.Also read: Award-winning reggae artist Fiji, known for Hawaiian and Polynesian hits, dies at 55 In discussions held in 2021 and 2023, villagers reported increased coastal erosion, saline intrusion into plantations, and extreme weather events such as Tropical Cyclone Winston in 2016, which destroyed homes and forced some residents to relocate inland."Sometimes the sea is coming further onto the land, so there's a lot of sea intrusion into the plantations," one resident explained.While some were able to move to customary mataqali land, others lacked access or preferred to remain near the coast.I think if I don't smell or hear the ocean for one day I would be devastated," a villager added.Women lead aquaculture and mangrove replanting efforts To address declining fish stocks and adapt to climate pressures, the women of the nearby Bia-I-Cake settlement, with a population of 60, have spearheaded community-led initiatives.The Bia-I-Cake Women's Cooperative launched a small-scale aquaculture project, farming tilapia and carp to reduce food insecurity and diversify local livelihoods.Supported by grants from the United Nations Development Programme and Women's Fund Fiji, the cooperative has built fish ponds, reared fish, and sold them through local markets and online platforms.The group also established a greenhouse to cultivate new crops and began mangrove replanting to mitigate coastal erosion."These efforts show women have the capacity to build a sustainable, secure and thriving community," one woman said.These initiatives reflect both a response to environmental challenges and an application of traditional stewardship practices tied to the Fijian concept of Vanua, a holistic view of the interconnectedness of land, sea, people, and customs.Community takes collective action for resource managementNagigi residents have taken additional steps to preserve marine resources.The village has temporarily closed customary fishing areas to allow fish populations to recover and is considering the declaration of a locally-managed marine area, or tabu.These measures respond to climate impacts, overfishing, and reef degradation.For generations, villagers have practiced resource protection, but these actions are now being formalized in the face of environmental threats.However, adaptation efforts remain uneven.Not all residents can afford relocation or reconstruction, and some lack access to customary land.Also read: UN's top court says failing to protect planet from climate change could violate international law The Nagigi case illustrates the significance of local adaptation strategies.The community has demonstrated an ability to assess risks, implement responses, and recover from climate-related damages using available social and ecological assets."Small communities are not just passive sites of loss.They are collectives of strength, agency and ingenuity," researchers noted.As climate adaptation efforts expand across the Pacific, support for community-led responses will be essential.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel) READ MORE NEWS ON Nagigi VillageFiji Climate ChangeSea Level RiseWomenews, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)Download The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.
