ranking it as the eighth most valuable non-banking financial company (NBFC) in India.11:29:18 AM IST, 02 Jul 2025HDB Financial Services Share Price Live: Post listing comments by Tarun Singh, MD and Founder, Highbrow SecuritiesThe 13% listing premium strikes a measured note, respectable without being euphoric, much like HDB Financial itself.The market appears to have carefully weighed its dual proposition, the stability of HDFC lineage against the challenges of a maturing NBFC sector.This outcome validates institutional confidence in HDB's pan-India distribution and RBI-compliant structure, while simultaneously acknowledging retail investors' prudent hesitation at current valuations.The moderate premium suggests the street views this as a steady compounder rather than a high-growth story a fair assessment given its 14% RoE and diversified book.Moving forward, HDB's ability to translate its parentage into consistent returns will determine whether today's listing proves to be a starting point or a peak.For now, it stands as a thoughtful addition to India's financial services landscape neither revolutionary nor disappointing, but importantly, credible.11:04:19 AM IST, 02 Jul 2025HDB

stake dilution could act as an overhang on the stock price in the near to medium term.Asset Quality Concerns:As of March 2025, HDB's Gross Stage 3 loans stood at 2.3% of total loans.A rise in defaults or delayed repayments could impact its asset quality and weigh on profitability.High Exposure to Unsecured Loans:Unsecured lending constituted 27.0% of the company's loan book as of March 2025.This segment typically carries higher credit risk and could lead to elevated provisioning in case of stress.Liquidity Risks:Any mismatch between assets and liabilities may lead to liquidity pressures,
