ETMarkets.com Analysts say the strong IPO run is being driven by a mix of healthy retail participation, attractive pricing, and sectoral diversity.In a year marked by cautious sentiment in secondary markets, India's IPO market has emerged as a surprising outperformer.While benchmark indices like the Nifty and Sensex have delivered modest returns of 6.2% and 5.3% respectively in 2025, fresh listings have raced ahead, offering investors a much-needed alternative.27 Out of 30 IPOs in Profit So far in 2025, 30 mainboard IPOs have listed, and 27 of them are trading above their issue price.The average return stands at 25%, nearly four times the Nifty's gain.While gold remains the top-performing asset class with a 31% year-to-date rise, IPOs have come a close second--outshining broader equity markets by a wide margin.Winners of the 2025 IPO Debuts Among the standout performers, Prostarm Info Systems has gained over 112%.Quality Power Electrical has more than doubled, delivering a 104.7% return since its February listing.Other notable gainers include Sambhv Steel Tubes (70.4%), Quadrant Future Tek (63.5%), Belrise Industries (45.2%), and Scoda Tubes (43.8%).At the same time, companies like Ellenbarrie Industrial Gases, Crizac, Anthem Biosciences, and Stallion India Fluorochemicals have delivered gains between 30-40%, despite broader market consolidation.Meanwhile, only three stocks, Indo Farm Equipment (-2.2%), Capital Infra Trust (-17.7%), and Arisinfra Solutions (-34.3%), have slipped below their issue prices.FPI Interest Remains in Primary Market While foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have been net sellers in the secondary market this year, their activity in the primary market paints a different picture.According to Dr. VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, FPIs tend to exit the secondary market when valuations are high but continue to participate in IPOs and QIPs where valuations are perceived as more reasonable."For 2025 up to July 19, total FPI sell figure stood at Rs 1.10 lakh crore, while buying through the primary market stood at Rs 27,239 crore," Vijayakumar added.What's Driving the IPO Momentum?Analysts say the strong IPO run is being driven by a mix of healthy retail participation, attractive pricing, and sectoral diversity.This year's offerings span a range of sectors--from EVs and clean tech to pharma and industrials--broadening investor appeal.Another factor is valuation.With stretched prices in the secondary market, investors are looking to IPOs for better entry points.Many recent IPOs saw overwhelming demand, with overall subscriptions often crossing 50x, and in some cases, going beyond 100x.Also read: Brigade Hotel Ventures' Rs 760 crore IPO opens: Should you subscribe or skip?While not every IPO has delivered blockbuster gains, the trend signals a meaningful shift in investor appetite.As long as secondary valuations remain elevated and new companies continue to price their offerings well, the momentum in the primary market is unlikely to fade.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.These do not represent the views of the Economic Times)(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channel)READ MORE NEWS ON Ipo Market IndiaBest Ipos 2025Ipo ReturnsNiftyFpiIn IposTop Performing IposPrimary Market TrendsIpo Investment 2025IPO Market PerformanceTop Performing IPOs 2025 (What's moving Sensex and Nifty Track latest market news, stock tips, Budget 2025, Share Market on Budget 2025 and expert advice, on ETMarkets.Also, ETMarkets.com is now on Telegram.For fastest news alerts on financial markets, investment strategies and stocks alerts, subscribe to our Telegram feeds .)Subscriband Sensex Today.Top Trending Stocks: SBI Share Price, Axis Bank Share Price, HDFC Bank Share Price, Infosys Share Price, Wipro Share Price, NTPC Share Price ...more
