For retail investors, the summer of 2025 is quickly turning into the latest meme stock moment.Stocks like Opendoor (OPEN), Kohl's (KSS), and Krispy Kreme (DNUT) have replaced yesterday's meme darlings like GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC), and now-shuttered Bed, Bath & Beyond as the latest market curiosities, treating investors to wild price swings with little fundamental backing to explain the moves.Opendoor stock is up more than 300% over the past month and saw a 140% increase in retail trading over the two weeks preceding Friday compared to the previous month, according to trading data platform VandaTrack.Even with a roughly 21% decline since the opening bell on Monday, the stock is up more than 50% over the last five days.On Wednesday, Krispy Kreme and GoPro (GPRO) rose by more than 90% and 70% in premarket trading, respectively -- the latest entrants in 2025's meme stock redux.Both swung to losses before the bell on Thursday, after coming off intraday highs to close with less-spectacular gains.What's driving the renewed interest in highly speculative bets on names long ago written off by Wall Street?According to Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick, the market environment is simply right for risk."I think more and more investors are feeling somewhat invulnerable right now," Sosnick told Yahoo Finance."Everything they've been trying has been working for them.If the basic stuff's working, why not try a bit more speculative stuff?"After a historic drop in stocks following President Trump's early April "Liberation Day" tariff surprise, the stock market has spent the past few months roaring back as worst-case scenarios for trade and the global economy appear less likely.Now, the S&P 500 is routinely hitting record highs, including on Wednesday.For investors who had the stomach to hold in early April, or even buy into the dip, those bets have largely worked out spectacularly well.And the winners haven't only been confined to the meme darlings mentioned above.The risk-on environment has been buoyed by steady belief in the AI trade by investors.Nvidia (NVDA) has seen its stock price increase by more than 90% since its April nadir, while shares in Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) have grown by more than 40% since their respective April lows.Crypto enthusiasm, which has also gotten a boost from the White House, along with a refreshed IPO market, has seen stocks like Coinbase (COIN), Circle Internet Group (CRCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV) -- which recently announced a $9 billion acquisition o%, 550%, and 200% since the start of the year, respectively.Robinhood Markets (HOOD), the retail investor-focused trading platform, is up more than 170% on the year.
