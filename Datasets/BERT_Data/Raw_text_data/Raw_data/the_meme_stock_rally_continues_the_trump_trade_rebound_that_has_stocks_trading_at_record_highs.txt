+ Meme stocks are running wild again.Some of the latest highfliers -- Krispy Kreme (DNUT), Opendoor (OPEN), and Kohl's (KSS) -- all have one key thing in common: They are heavily shorted stocks.This means investors have been betting that the next price move for these names will be lower, and some strategists suggest that this week's meme surge is merely the latest pillar of a consistent theme during the S&P 500's 25% rally over the last three months."A lot of what has outperformed significantly [since the market bottom], obviously the memes, but the heavily shorted stocks of every variety," Charles Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday."So I think there may be that also added attempt on the part of the retail trader to press those shorts and force a repositioning on the part of speculators and institutions."Short sellers have lost just shy of $355 billion since the market bottom on April 8, according to data from S3 Partners.That includes more than $100 billion in losses since Yahoo Finance last published S3's data on May 22.Since President Trump first reversed his starkest tariff stance on April 9, betting against the roaring stock market rally has been a losing strategy.And the market's V-shape recovery has been more than a simple "Trump Always Chickens Out" (TACO) trade.Between April 8 and May 20, short sellers lost more than $35 billion betting against the "Magnificent Seven" tech cohort, which has once again been a key driver of the market's chug higher."The market was caught short at a time when there was no actual fundamental information available," BNP Paribas head of debt and equity strategy Viktor Hjort told Yahoo Finance.As Trend Labs founder JC Parets wrote in a research note on Wednesday, the stock market's rise is largely about investor "mispositioning."Parets cited a Wall Street Journal poll of economists from April 12, which showed nearly half expected a recession in the next 12 months."These economists had everyone convinced a recession was coming," Parets wrote.So far, that downturn has not come to pass, but investors continue to be caught short as the fundamental story for stocks and the economy has proven to be largely better than feared.o find where trades are most out of place.After falling almost 30% to start the year, Cathie Wood's Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up nearly 90% from the April bottom.
