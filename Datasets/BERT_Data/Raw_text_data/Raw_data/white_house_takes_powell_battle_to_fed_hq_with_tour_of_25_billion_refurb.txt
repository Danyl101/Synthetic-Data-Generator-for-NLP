+ Renovations at the Federal Reserve are set to get a high-profile probing today when President Trump and his allies visit the central bank's headquarters after weeks of mounting criticisms over a $2.5 billion renovation.Trump is set to arrive at 4:00 p.m. ET in a highly unusual presidential visit to the building on the National Mall, less than a mile from the White House.The construction site tour is just one of numerous political pressure points being put before Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by Trump and his team -- even as the latest rhetoric from the president and Treasury Secretary Bessent has downplayed the chances of any imminent attempt to fire the central banker."In eight months, he'll be out," Trump noted on Tuesday, with Bessent adding Wednesday in various television appearances that "we're in no rush" to change leadership and that a new chair nominee would be announced in December or January.In short, Powell's job is looking slightly more secure this week -- but the central bank chief's problems clearly aren't going away.Up first is today's visit from Trump.The focus there is ongoing construction of the Federal Reserve headquarters amid critiques from newly appointed Trump allies on the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) that could go so far as to seek to stop ongoing construction pending further review.In addition to Trump, today's tour is expected to include White House deputy chief of staff James Blair (who is also a new member of the NCPC), budget director Russell Vought, and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, who has emerged as another vocal Powell critic.The Federal Reserve building is seen on July 18 as it undergoes construction in Washington, D.C.
